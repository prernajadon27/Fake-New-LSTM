# Fake-News LSTM

## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of a **Fake News Detection** system using **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks. The model is designed to classify news articles as **fake or real** based on their textual content.

## Key Features
- Implements **LSTM**, a powerful recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture, for **sequential text classification**.
- Trained on a **large dataset** of news articles with labeled categories to ensure high accuracy.
- Incorporates **text preprocessing** techniques such as tokenization, word embedding, and padding.
- Uses **TensorFlow/Keras** for building and training the deep learning model.
- Supports **real-time fake news detection**, allowing users to input articles and receive predictions.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (for data processing and model implementation)
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (for deep learning)
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques for text analysis
- **Pandas & NumPy** (for data manipulation)

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/krishnaik06/Fake-New-LSTM.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Fake-New-LSTM
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the script to train and test the model:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

## Usage
- Modify `train.py` to include additional preprocessing steps if needed.
- Load a pre-trained model and use `predict.py` to classify new articles.
